In fall 2014 the Centre on Aging ([COAG](http://www.coag.uvic.ca/)) offered  [Methodology Colloquium lecture series](http://ialsa.github.io/COAG-colloquium-2014F/) focusing on the issue of reproducible research and specifically organization of research workflow with RStudio.  Five out of six lectures gave a demonstration of a minimalist project in statistical modeling. A sequence of multilevel models was reported using knitr and rmarkdown R packages. Basic R and ggplot syntax was surveyed. Examples were given on report organization and the design of the model sequence.
