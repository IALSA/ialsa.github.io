Five out of six lectures gave a demonstration of a minimalist project in statistical modeling. A sequence of multilevel models was reported using knitr and rmarkdown R packages. Basic R and ggplot syntax was surveyed. Examples were given on report organization and the design of the model sequence.\n\n----\n\n\n\n[logo]:./images/ialsa_long.png",
